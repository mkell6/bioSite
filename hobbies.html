<h2>In his downtime, Andrew enjoys a range of hobbies, and most of them involve theoutdoors. He enjoys an active lifestyle with an affinity for racquetball and weightlifting. Youcan find him in the gym everyday playing racquetball within the club that he founded! He alsoenjoys camping and hiking when he has the chance to do so, though unfortunately options are limited in Nebraska. One of his fondest memories within the past year were hiking alongside the Grand Tetons in Wyoming.His weekends are often relatively laid-back, with a hearty Sunday breakfast, some quality time at the park with the very energetic Sammy, and the occasional visit to the shooting range.When it comes to reading, 'Don Quixote' is his top pick for its enduring humor. He evenconvinced his wife to read the 1000+ page book, so it must be good.</h2>
